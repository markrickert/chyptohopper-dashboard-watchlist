# User Scripts to Improve your Cryptohopper Experience

This is a small collection of userscripts that run on [cryptohopper.com](https://www.cryptohopper.com/?atid=16750) to enhance your experience. Each userscript focuses on one tweak or feature and can be run independent of the others. Run them all or just a few!

**What Is Cryptohopper?**

Cryptohopper is an algorithmic trading platform that interfaces with your crypto exchange to trade cryptocurrency on your behalf using market trends, signals, and strategies. It watches the market 24/7 and tries to determine the best time to enter a position and then sell at a predetermined profit target.

* Clear all watchlist colors by clicking the `X` at the top of the new watchlist column.
* Adds row colors to the Last 5 Sells table and the trade history page.

## remove-hoppie.user.js

* Permanently hide hoppie's hand from poking out of the side of the screen.

## stay-level-headed.user.js

* Removes those pesky emotions and hides the panic button from the dashboard so you can't click it in a moment of weakness.

## export-saved-trade-history.user.js

* Adds new functionality to the trade history page that allows saving and loading export settings, and another that allows the user to export in a single click using the saved settings, after saving at least once. The author of this script finds it useful to set the *to* part of the date range to sometime in the future when using this functionality, such as 01/01/2030 12:00 AM.
