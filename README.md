# A Set of User Scripts to Customize your Cryptohopper Experience

This is a small collection of userscripts that run on [cryptohopper.com](https://www.cryptohopper.com/?atid=16750) to enhance your experience. Each userscript focuses on one tweak or feature and can be run independent of the others. Run them all or just a few!

**What Is Cryptohopper?**

Cryptohopper is an algorithmic trading platform that interfaces with your crypto exchange to trade cryptocurrency on your behalf using market trends, signals, and strategies. It watches the market 24/7 and tries to determine the best time to enter a position and then sell at a predetermined profit target.

**Motivation**

The Cryptohopper service is amazing! It has almost become an obsession of mine to watch the bot buy and sell all day long. Being a lifelong tweaker and optimizer, natually, I wanted to enhance the site with a few customizations that tailored my experience.

I created some of these scripts for personal use, and after sharing a few screenshots online I started getting requests for how others could do the same thing, leading me to make this project.

Since then multiple community members have contributed tweaks, fixes, testing efforts, and even entirely new scripts! I hope this repo can become a trusted community resource for those wishing to fine-tune their user experience in different ways.

## ⚠️ Security implications: ⚠️

Cryptohopper may change their website at any moment, causing one or all of these scripts to cease functioning.

## coin-watchlist.user.js

* Allows you to track a coin by icon/color across all your hoppers. Highlight the losers or mark positions that are heavily dollar cost averaged to more easily visually identify them in your dashboard or mark coins that are part of a custom config pool.
* Clear individual coin watches by cycling through the list in the Open Positions table.
* Clear all watchlist colors by clicking the `X` at the top of the new watchlist column.
* Adds row colors to the Last 5 Sells table and the trade history page.
* Looks great in light and dark mode!

> Note: Some users are served the chart on `chart/chart_tradingview.php` and this script will not work if your charts are loaded from there. It will only work on the `chart/chart.php` url.

## position-targets.user.js

* Puts a target icon next to each currency symbol when it is on the target buy/sell list for easier tracking of what the bot is recommending to buy or sell.

> Note: This will also show targets that are hidden by default in the targets list.

## target-restore.user.js

> By [@henrygarle](https://github.com/henrygarle) (FaceWound on Discord)

* Restores targets list to match functionality removed on 2021-05-11. Any targets that would be shown by the default UI are shown in green, any that would normally be hidden are displayed in orange.

## remove-hoppie.user.js

* Permanently hide hoppie's hand from poking out of the side of the screen.

## stay-level-headed.user.js

* Removes those pesky emotions and hides the panic button from the dashboard so you can't click it in a moment of weakness.

## multi-select.user.js

> By [@eatsleepcoderepeat-gl](https://github.com/eatsleepcoderepeat-gl) (Xerahn on Discord)

* Adds shift+click functionality for position checkboxes to allow selecting all positions of the same coin/token at once.

## export-saved-trade-history.user.js

> By [@eatsleepcoderepeat-gl](https://github.com/eatsleepcoderepeat-gl) (Xerahn on Discord)

* Adds new functionality to the trade history page that allows for single click exports using the saved settings (after saving at least once), and allows for saving and loading export settings. The author of this script finds it useful to set the *to* part of the date range to sometime in the future when using this functionality, such as 01/01/2030 12:00 AM.
